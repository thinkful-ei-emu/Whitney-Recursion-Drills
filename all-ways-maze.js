// 9. Find ALL the ways out of the maze
// Use the above maze and modify your solution so it finds All the possible 
// exits through the Maze. To find all possible exit through the maze, 
// think about how many places you can move at each turn. Possibly up, 
// down, left or right?

// Notice that this maze has 3 exits. Your recursive function should 
// print all three of the paths with the proper directions. For example, 
// given the maze above, the program should output the following:

// Path to the exit: RRDDLLDDRRRRRR
// Path to the exit: RRDDRRUURRDDDD
// Path to the exit: RRDDRRRRDD

// Questions:
// What is the input to the program? 
// What is the output of the program? 
// What is the input to each recursive call? 
// What is the output of each recursive call?
